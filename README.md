Welcome to Capstone Fall 2025

When making changes and adding new scripts/gameobjects makes sure it is under the right folders and properly labled. If not I will be fixing it or your branch won't get published. :( 
If you add any packages please mention it in the pull request you publish as it might cause errors if not updated or imported correctly thanks :)
